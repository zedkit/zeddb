      # = ZedDB Database Models
      #
      # All ZedDB application databases have models. You can create, read, update, or delete models. To perform an 
      # operation on a specific model you need its UUID, as available from the Websites.models method.
      #
      # To get a Model:
      #
      #   ZedDB::Models.get(:user_key => user['user_key'], :uuid => model['uuid'])
      #
      # To update a Model:
      # 
      #   ZedDB::Models.update(:user_key => user['user_key'], :uuid => model['uuid'])
      #
      # To delete a Model:
      #
      #   ZedDB::Models.delete(:user_key => user['user_key'], :uuid => model['uuid'])
      #
      # To create a new Model you submit the required parameters with the project UUID that you are creating the 
      # model for. Whatever items you send within the :model Hash are passed through to the ZedAPI untouched.
      # There is no client side validation within this gem.
      #
      #   ZedDB::Models.create(:user_key => user['user_key'],
      #                        :project => { :uuid => project['uuid'] }, :model => { :name => 'whatever' })
      #
      # From each of these requests the Zedkit::Client class will return a response hash for your reference, if needed,
      # or as applicable to the request. If there was a HTTP 401 or 404 you will get a nil response. This indicates a
      # security failure or that an UUID is incorrect, not attached the user's account, or non-existent.
      #
      # For each request you can also pass a block to process the response directly:
      #
      #   ZedDB::Models.get(:user_key => user['user_key'], :uuid => model['uuid']) do |result|
      #   end
      #
