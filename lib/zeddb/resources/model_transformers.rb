      # = ZedDB Model Transformers
      #
      # ZedDB model data items can have standard "transformers" attached to them -- actions to be performed on the data item
      # just before it is saved to the underlying storage system. You can create or delete model item transformers.
      # A model item's transformers are listed within its response data set.
      #
      # To create a new Model Transformer you submit the required parameters of the transformer type with the model item
      # UUID that you are attaching a transformer to. Whatever items you send within the :transformer Hash are passed through
      # to the ZedAPI untouched. There is no client side validation within this gem.
      #
      #   ZedDB::ModelTransformers.create(:user_key => user['user_key'], :item => { :uuid => item['uuid'] },
      #                                   :transformer => { :code => 'UP' })
      #
      # To delete a Model Transformer:
      #
      #   ZedDB::ModelTransformers.delete(:user_key => user['user_key'], :uuid => transformer['uuid])
      #
      # From each of these requests the Zedkit::Client class will return a response hash for your reference, if needed,
      # or as applicable to the request. If there was a HTTP 401 or 404 you will get a nil response. This indicates a
      # security failure or that an UUID is incorrect, not attached the user's account, or non-existent.
      #
      # For each request you can also pass a block to process the response directly:
      #
      #   ZedDB::ModelTransformers.delete(:user_key => user['user_key'], :uuid => transformer['uuid]) do |result|
      #   end
      #
