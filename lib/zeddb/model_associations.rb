      #
      # = ZedDB Model Associations
      #
      # ZedDB models can be associated with each other in predetermined ways. You can create or delete model associations.
      # A model's associations are listed within its response data set.
      #
      # To create a new Model Assocation you submit the required parameters of the association type with the model UUIDs that
      # you are creating an association between. Whatever items you send within the :association Hash are passed through to
      # the ZedAPI untouched. There is no client side validation within this gem.
      #
      # Associations can be confusing to create, given that the order is arbitary. But you would read an association as
      # Model B belongs to Model A. So, to create a belongs_to association. You would be using the resource location based
      # on Model B, creating an association to Model A, with "first" and "second" labels as you read the association aloud.
      #
      #   ZedDB::ModelAssociations.create(:user_key => user['user_key'],
      #                                   :association => { :first => model_b['uuid'],
      #                                                     :code => 'BT', :inverse => 'HM', :second => model_b['uuid] })
      #
      # To delete a Model Association:
      #
      #   ZedDB::ModelAssociations.delete(:user_key => user['user_key'], :uuid => association['uuid])
      #
      # From each of these requests the Zedkit::Client class will return a response hash for your reference, if needed,
      # or as applicable to the request. If there was a HTTP 401 or 404 you will get a nil response. This indicates a
      # security failure or that an UUID is incorrect, not attached the user's account, or non-existent.
      #
      # For each request you can also pass a block to process the response directly:
      #
      #   ZedDB::ModelAssociations.delete(:user_key => user['user_key'], :uuid => association['uuid]) do |result|
      #   end
      #
